CC2500 thing
===========================

This is a module for the CC2500 wireless chip from TI, made in Eagle. Though modules are already available, I was unable to find any that were open source, which was annoying, so I made one for you to have and play with.

It uses a folded dipole antenna, because that's way easier to lay out (and I don't know anything about wireless). For more info see TI CC2500 Design Note DN004, which, if you're lucky, might be at http://www.ti.com/lit/an/swra118/swra118.pdf.

You may have noticed the part where I mention I don't know anything about wireless (aside from the fact that Jesus used it to fool the Mayans into believing he'd turned water into slightly older water). Well, since I don't know anything about wireless, this may totally not work. I think it will, but unfortunately it's literally impossible to ever find out.

Feel free to fork this and add changes as necessary. I'll license this with the horribly named Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License. Which means, more or less, tell people you got it from me, and if you distribute it, use the same license.

That said, if you do actually sell these, I wouldn't *mind* a kickback. But I won't require one, because that's annoying.
